This file is for requests for changes in another person's source files. Until
they change their code, but make a stub to compile your own (or you can edit
their code and reverse the edit before you commit.) MAKE SURE NOT TO EDIT
THE CODE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION because otherwise you might edit the same
area - even in the exact same way - and cause a conflict, which will block
all but one person from committing anything.

Remember to let the person know that you added a request for them to edit
something, because we shouldn't expect each other to check here every time.
This is just so we don't have to clog WhatsApp with requests that will just
get lost.

Requests By Natalie

Everyone

Confirmation messages should be printed within the User Interface package,
not within AddTask, EditTask, etc. Just return your task and let
CommandHandler call the correct method to form a confirmation message. I
only ask this because we need to keep dependencies to a minimum. 

The same goes with error messages - throw an error and let the caller handle 
telling the user that their request isn't doable.

Yui

In response to our earlier conversation, totally keep passing the
example task to Editor, etc, but make the task forming methods be
part of a class in something else. Maybe TaskFactory? I won't be 
editing that any more, so you can have at it. Nice job coordinating
that with Nelson, too! You guys are awesome~. I'll admit that my first
instinct was wrong; I think you had the right idea from the start.
Sorry for telling you otherwise

Need to make public methods in CommandHandler static since we don't
need to have an instance of CommandHandler. Also, change its argument
list to be (Command cmd, FileIo IoStream) so you can pass it as an
argument to the Data Manipulation methods like you're trying to do.
(which is what the API says, so you're right in doing so. I think I
messed up on your API)
