This file is for requests for changes in another person's source files. Until
they change their code, but make a stub to compile your own (or you can edit
their code and reverse the edit before you commit.) MAKE SURE NOT TO EDIT
THE CODE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION because otherwise you might edit the same
area - even in the exact same way - and cause a conflict, which will block
all but one person from committing anything.

Remember to let the person know that you added a request for them to edit
something, because we shouldn't expect each other to check here every time.
This is just so we don't have to clog WhatsApp with requests that will just
get lost.

Natalie: I need a method that helps me establish what link the user has entered. 
As of now, I had assumed that AND and OR are still regarded as component types rather than Link. 
It would be cool if we could do this Link for V0.3.
